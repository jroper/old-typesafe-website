<h1>Summary of the Typesafe Console<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-the-typesafe-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Typesafe Subscription includes the Typesafe Console, an enterprise-grade
dashboard for monitoring your application built on the Typesafe Stack, including
Akka event-driven middleware. The Typesafe Console is exclusively available to
Typesafe Subscription customers.</p>
<p>The Typesafe Console is a tailor-made tracing and monitoring solution for event-driven
Akka actor based systems. The Typesafe Console captures the events that comprise your
application’s asynchronous processing, links those events into meaningful trace flows
across actors and remote nodes, and makes this information actionable to developers
and operations staff through a rich web-based user interface.</p>
<p>The Typesafe Console provides insight into usage trends and performance characteristics
of the running system. The Console enables your staff to optimize system performance and
detect bottlenecks before they become a problem, but also to understand reasons for current
or historical problems.</p>
<p>Typesafe Console monitoring has been carefully designed to be always active in
high-volume production environments with a minimal impact on performance. For
high transaction rate systems it provides measurement sampling to reduce the
overhead and amount of data.</p>
<p>In addition to the web user interface, aggregated metrics and detailed trace
flows are also accessible through a REST and JMX API, for easy integration with third
party monitoring and operations tools. Both historical and current monitoring
information is available, which makes it possible to compare across time and
analyze trends. The information can be scoped: by node, groups of actors, or
even drilling down to individual actors.</p>
<p>The Typesafe Console includes probes to collect the following information from
a Typesafe Stack based system:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>message rates and peaks</li>
<li>individual trace events linked as trace trees or spans</li>
<li>latency between predefined or user defined points</li>
<li>latency distributions</li>
<li>actor supervisor hierarchies</li>
<li>actor mailbox queue size and delays</li>
<li>actor message dispatcher status</li>
<li>status of remoting and system errors</li>
<li>metadata about the system</li>
<li>JVM and OS health</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can look at the console for a live demo application <a class="reference external" href="http://console-demo.typesafe.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please contact <em>info&#64;typesafe.com</em> for more information or trial of the Typesafe Console.</p>

<h2>Graphical Console<a class="headerlink" href="#graphical-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is what the dashboard looks like. Key metrics visualized in nice-looking graphs,
animations and numbers.</p>
<img alt="../_images/console_first.png" src="../_images/console_first.png" />
<p>And here’s a closer look at the system overview, which displays information about the whole system.</p>
<img alt="../_images/console_system_overview.png" src="../_images/console_system_overview.png" />
<p>A node corresponds to a JVM.
The circle gives a quick overview of the current health of the node, and if any
errors have occurred. Details about the errors, including the full tree of trace
events are one click away.</p>
<img alt="../_images/console_node_expanded.png" src="../_images/console_node_expanded.png" />
<p>Actors can be grouped into logical units using tags, and statistics are aggregated
for all actors associated with a given tag.</p>
<p>Another interesting way of grouping statistics for the actors is by their message
dispatcher. Insight to the dispatcher status, such as number of active threads,
is also available.</p>
<p>At the lowest level of detail you can see individual actors.</p>

<h2>How to Find a Bottleneck<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-find-a-bottleneck" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through one of many useful features of the console.</p>
<p>Mailbox queues are interesting to monitor in an actor system. An increasing number of messages waiting in
mailboxes is an indication of a problem. If mailboxes are growing constantly it is a fatal problem
(memory will be exhausted).</p>
<p>Directly in the system overview pane you see <em>Max mailbox size</em>. In this example, the value is not
very high, but several messages are waiting in the queue. The <em>Max time in mailbox</em>
also makes us curious, because a half second of waiting time is more than we would expect.</p>
<img alt="../_images/tour_bottleneck1.png" src="../_images/tour_bottleneck1.png" />
<p>We click on the <em>Max mailbox size</em> or <em>Max time in mailbox</em> value to go directly to the actor with the
potential problem.</p>
<p>In the graphs for the mailbox we can see that we have peaks in both the size and wait time, and it
looks like they correlate with the peaks in the message throughput. The good news is that the actor is
capable of processing the queue before the next peak of messages. The mailbox size is not increasing
continually so it&#8217;s not a big worry, but the application would not be able to handle a sustained
load corresponding to the message rate of the peaks.</p>
<img alt="../_images/tour_bottleneck2.png" src="../_images/tour_bottleneck2.png" />
<p>Let&#8217;s compare with another actor. As you see the mailbox graphs for ActorA and ActorB looks very
different. Note the scale of the y-axis.</p>

<div class="section" id="technical-details">
<h2>Technical Details<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The monitoring backend is highly influenced by a paper from Google which
outlines <a class="reference external" href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html">Dapper</a>, a highly scalable tracing service
for distributed systems.</p>
<p>In short, metadata is added to the messages as they flow through the
system, both across component boundaries as well as across the network. This
means that it is possible to follow message chains in the distributed
system. All these trace events are captured in a very efficient way using a
combination of thread local state and local buffering before they are emitted to
storage and off-line analysis.</p>
<img alt="../_images/modules.png" src="../_images/modules.png" />
<p>Trace data is collected in the application using an instrumented version
of Akka. The trace events are written to storage and consumed by an analysis
server to produce aggregated statistics. The analytics is performed close to
real-time, but off-line from the application.
The information is visualized in the graphical console.</p>
<p>All information is also available through a REST API, which is useful for integration with
other monitoring tools or for developing your own dashboard.
Most information is also available as JMX MBeans.
Please see the <a class="reference external" href="http://console-demo.typesafe.com/monitoring/api.html">REST API Description</a> for
more on the available APIs.</p>
<p>There are, at present, three ways of persisting the trace events:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Writing directly to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a></li>
<li>Sending to a remote actor, which writes to MongoDB</li>
<li>Sending to a <a class="reference external" href="https://cwiki.apache.org/FLUME/">Flume</a> agent, which
transports to a Flume collector, which writes to MongoDB</li>
</ul>
<p>A span is the path between two trace events; especially the duration between these events
is interesting. One typical, built-in, span type is the time to send and process messages for actors.
It&#8217;s also possible to define application specific markers for spans that start and end in any
location in the message trace, i.e. it may span over several actors.
Statistics will be calculated for this in the same way as the built-in span types.</p>
<p>The graphical console has been developed in collaboration with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zenexity.com/">Zenexity</a> and
the console itself is built with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.playframework.org/2.0">Play 2.0</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>.</p>
<p>The tracing and monitoring solution has been developed with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://akka.io/">Akka 2.0</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/typesafehub/play2-mini">Play2 Mini</a>.</p>
