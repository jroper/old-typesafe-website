Migration Manager: Step-by-step Guide
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the step-by-step guide to the Migration Manager (MiMa).

MiMa can report binary modifications that may lead the JVM throwing a `java.lang.LinkageError <http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/LinkageError.html>`_ (or one of its subtypes, like `AbstractMethodError`) at runtime. `LinkageErrors` are usually the consequence of modifications in classes/members signature. 

MiMa compares all classfiles of two released libraries and reports all source of incompatibilities that may lead to a `LinkageError`.  MiMa provides you, the library maintainer, with a tool that can greatly automates and simplifies the process of ensuring the release-to-release binary compatibility of your libraries.  

A key aspect of MiMa to be aware of is that it only looks for syntactic binary incompatibilities. The semantic binary incompatibilities (such as adding or removing a method invocation) are not considered. This is a pragmatic approach as it is up to you, the library maintainer, to make sure that no semantic changes have occurred between two binary compatible releases. If a semantic change occurred, then you should make sure to provide this information as part of the new release's change list.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that binary compatibility does not imply source compatibility, i.e., some of the changes that are considered compatible at the bytecode level may still break a codebase that depends on it. Interestingly, this is not an issue intrinsic to the Scala language.  In the Java language binary compatibility does not imply source compatibility as well.  MiMa focuses on binary compatibility and currently provides no insight into source compatibility.

The current version of MiMa provides an aggresive reporting module for finding all potential binary incompatibilties. 


Prerequisites
-------------

If you haven't yet download the Migration Manager, you can do so `here <http://typesafe.com/technology/migration-manager>`_. Three different packages are available so that you can pick the one that suits your platform.  Your options are:

1. A GUI tool
2. A command line tool
3. A SBT plugin

This guide assumes that you have Java 1.6 or later installed on you machine and ``java`` on your ``PATH``.
 
You need to make sure that ``$JAVA_HOME`` environment variable is set to the root of the Java distribution. You also need to make sure that the ``$JAVA_HOME/bin`` is on your ``PATH``.

.. code-block:: text

    $ export JAVA_HOME=..root of java distribution..
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

You can test your installation by invoking ``java``.

.. code-block:: text

    $ java -version
    java version "1.6.0_24"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b07-334-10M3326)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.1-b02-334, mixed mode)

Using the MiMa GUI
------------------

Simply double click on the downloaded jar and MiMa will start. If this is the first time you are running MiMa you will be asked to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA). Once accepted, it will remember it so that you will not be asked again.

.. image:: ../images/mima/1-eula.png

After clicking ``Next`` you will be asked to select the libraries' JAR that you want to compare. 

.. image:: ../images/mima/2-select-libs.png

To correctly perform the analysis MiMa needs that all the library's dependencies are added in the ``Library classpath``. For convenience, MiMa tries to automatically add the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) libraries. 

.. image:: ../images/mima/3-select-lib-classpath.png

Once the library's classpath has been correctly set up, click ``Next``. This will start the analysis and MiMa will compare all classfiles looking for binary incompatibilities between the two releases. MiMa analysis time is typically short however it does depends on the size of your library and its dependencies. When MiMa analysis is complete, you will see a table containing a list of diagnosed incompatibilities. When clicking on a row, a panel providing all details about the selected incompatibility is displayed. Simply use the up/down keyboards' keys to navigate through the incompatibilities, the panel displaying the description will update accordingly. Filters can be composed to narrow down a specific issue.

.. image:: ../images/mima/4-result-issue-selected.png

Last, in the bottom-right corner it is reported the number of collected incompatibilities.

.. image:: ../images/mima/4-result-number-incompatibilities.png

In the future MiMa will provide categories and levels of binary incompatibilities os that you can focus on those that are important to your project.


Using the command line
----------------------
After downloading the command line tool, you can invoke it as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    $ java -jar <path/to/mima-reporter-assembly.jar> \
      --prev <path/to/previous.jar> \
      --curr <path/to/next/jar>

This will print all incompatibilities to directly to the console.

SBT Plugin
----------
The SBT Plugin is released for SBT version 0.11.3. To try it, do the following:

Add the following to your project/project/build.scala file:

.. code-block:: text

    resolvers += Resolver.url("sbt-plugin-releases", new URL("http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

    addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe" % "sbt-mima-plugin" % "0.1.3")


Add the following to your build.sbt file:

.. code-block:: text

    import com.typesafe.tools.mima.plugin.MimaPlugin.mimaDefaultSettings
    import com.typesafe.tools.mima.plugin.MimaKeys.previousArtifact

    mimaDefaultSettings

    previousArtifact := Some("com.jsuereth" % "scala-arm_2.9.1" % "1.2")

But replacing the scala-arm example with your own artifact.

Run mima-report-binary-issues. You should see something like the following:

.. code-block:: text

    [info] Found 4 potential binary incompatibilities
    [error]  * method rollbackTransactionResource()resource.Resource in object resource.Resource does not have a correspondent in new version
