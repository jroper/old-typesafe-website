Installing the Typesafe Stack
=============================

The Typesafe Stack is downloadable in several flavors depending on your preferred choice of platform.
When installing the Typesafe Stack you will have access to Scala, `sbt` and `giter8` on your local system.

Scala, Play and Akka starter/sample projects can be installed via `giter8` templates - see :ref:`template-projects`.

After the Stack has been installed you can try it out by opening a terminal window and type::

    $Â scala -version

Windows 
-------

Download and run `this exe file <http://typesafe.artifactoryonline.com/typesafe/windows-releases/com/typesafe/typesafe-stack/2.0/typesafe-stack-2.0.exe>`_. Follow the installer instructions.


OSX
---

Use `Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_ to install - open a terminal window and type::

    $ brew install scala sbt maven giter8    

You can exclude the packages you don't need (done by not including them in the line above).
We do, however, recommend that you as a minimum install Scala, `sbt` (or `Maven` if you are 
developing in Java) and `giter8`.


Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

First you need to add the Typesafe repository information to your list of trusted sources in order for ``apt`` to work properly. 
Download `this file <http://apt.typesafe.com/repo-deb-build-0002.deb>`_ and install it (by opening the file in Ubuntu Software Center);
this will properly set-up the ``apt.typesafe.com`` repository in ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/typesafe-apt.list``.

Open a terminal window and type::

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install typesafe-stack


Redhat/CentOS - Download RPM
----------------------------

Click on `this link <http://typesafe-repo-2.0.0-1.noarch.rpm>`_ to install the RPM.


Redhat/CentOS - Yum
-------------------

Create a file called ``typesafe.repo`` in the folder ``/etc/yum.repos.d/`` containing this information::

    [typesafe]
    name=Typesafe Rpm Repository
    baseurl=http://rpm.typesafe.com/
    enabled=1

Next, open a terminal window and type::

    $ yum install typesafe-stack


Universal
---------

Download `this zip file <http://typesafe.artifactoryonline.com/typesafe/>`_ and unpack it to your local file system.
