Downloading and installing
============================================================

Download the Typesafe Stack from `http://typesafe.com/stack/download <http://typesafe.com/stack/download>`_. There you can select the installer that fits your platform best:

- ``.exe`` for Windows
- ``.dmg`` for Mac
- ``.jar`` for platform independent

Now let's install the stack by double-clicking on the installer. You are free to install only the components you need, the installer will make sure that dependencies among components are correctly resolved.

I choose to install the stack into ``/Users/jboner/tools/typesafe-stack``.

If we now step into the directory where we installed the stack in you can see that the distribution looks like this (for a full install).
